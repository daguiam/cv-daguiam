abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V. New ICRF (Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequency) antennas, targeted to reduce impurity generation in the all-metal ASDEX Upgrade were designed and fabricated at different sites in an international cooperation between IPP, ASIPP (Hefei, China) and ENEA (Frascati, Italy). Installation and test were done by a multinational team at IPP. The antenna further integrates a powerful reflectometer system, designed and built by ENEA and IST (Portugal). The project, with the cooperation of four institutes in four countries on two continents was successfully completed within budget and schedule boundaries. Test results, gathered during recent experiment campaign, reveal that the new antennas have achieved their goal: A significant reduction of ICRF heating induced W impurity generation at the antennas.},

abstract = {A 1D MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) mirror for LiDAR applications, based on vertically asymmetric comb-drive electrostatic actuators, is presented in this work employing a novel fabrication process. This novel micromachining process combines typical SOI-based bulk micromachining and grayscale lithography, enabling the fabrication of combs actuators with asymmetric heights using a single lithography step in the active layer. With this technique, the fabrication process is simplified, and the overall costs are reduced since the number of required lithography steps decrease. The fabricated mirrors present self-aligned electrodes with a 2.8$\mu$ m gap and asymmetric heights of the movable and the fixed electrodes of 20 $\mu$ m and 50 $\mu$ m, respectively. These asymmetric actuators are an essential feature for the operation mode of this device, enabling both in resonant and static mode operation. A mirror field of view (FOV) of 54° at 838 Hz was achieved under low-pressure, when resonantly operated, and a FOV of 0.8° in the static mode.},

abstract = {The development and implementation of a portable eddy currents testing instrument with heterodyning based measurements is presented in this paper. The instrument is composed by a dedicated electronic measurement circuitry embedded inside a rugged tablet computer for control and visualization and that interfaces a small footprint planar eddy currents probe. A DDS waveform generator and a transconductance amplifier are used to drive the probe current. The probe output voltage is amplified up to 60dB and down-converted to an intermediary frequency, which is then digitized. IQ demodulation of the digitized signal is used to obtain the real and imaginary components of the probe output and is computed in real time by the embedded digital signal processor and transmitted to the host computer by USB. The eddy currents testing instrument can be operated as a battery powered standalone device with post-processing and visualization capabilities which can be modified for specific applications without the need for hardware modifications. The system architecture, electrical characterization of the analog circuit, digital signal processing and visualization interface are described. The eddy currents inspection results of an aluminum sample with synthetic defects and friction stir welding joint samples, using this instrument are presented.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2020 IEEE. Predictive maintenance has been growing as one of the main topics of the Industry 4.0 concept and several challenges arise from it. The constant search for mechanisms that allow the control and reduction of machine down-time led to the study of new ways of extracting valuable information from injection tools through the monitorization of different parameters. In the study presented here, a custom pressure sensor is integrated into an injection tool to monitor the different pressure levels along the process cycle, together with a commercial off-the-shelf accelerometer, coupled at the surface of the tool. Both sensors recorded the events over regular productive cycles, being this information, in the long-term, paramount for a smart predictive maintenance. The runtime information can also give valuable insights about the tool condition in real-time.},

The physics of Radio-Frequency (RF) wave heating in the Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies (ICRF) in the core plasmas of fusion devices are relatively well understood while those in the Scrape-Off Layer (SOL) remain still unresolved. This paper is dedicated to study the ICRF interactions with the plasma edge, mainly from the theoretical and numerical point of view, in particular with the 3D edge plasma fluid and neutral transport code EMC3-EIRENE and various wave codes. Here emphasis is given to the improvement of ICRF coupling with local gas puffing and to the ICRF induced density convection in the SOL.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Max-Planck-Institut fur Plasmaphysik. Plasma heating with waves in the ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF) affects the edge plasma and the edge plasma affects the ICRF heating. In simulations, these nonlinear ICRF - edge plasma interactions have been self-consistently simulated by running the EMC3-EIRENE, RAPLICASOL and SSWICH codes in an iterative way on ASDEX Upgrade for the first time. In experiments, the edge plasma convection induced by powered 3-strap antennas is measured with the antenna embedded reflectometers for the first time. Both the simulation and experimental results indicate that the ICRF induced convective cells are most significant on the top and bottom of the antennas; the edge plasma convection induced by 3-strap antennas in optimized antenna feeding configuration (dipole phasing, power ratio between the center and outer straps ∼1.5) is smallest among the studied cases. The simulation results also suggest that compared to the 2-strap antennas, the 3-strap antennas can significantly reduce the plasma convection associated with the radio-frequency sheaths, even with unfavorable power balance between the straps in dipole phasing.},

The recent scientific research on ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) has greatly advanced solutions to two issues of Radio Frequency (RF) heating in the Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies (ICRF): (a) the coupling of ICRF power to the plasma is significantly improved by density tailoring with local gas puffing; (b) the release of RF-specific impurities is significantly reduced by minimizing the RF near field with 3-strap antennas. This paper summarizes the applied methods and reviews the associated achievements.},

@article{Elsayed2015,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1992-2012 IEEE. This paper presents a combined magnetometer/accelerometer sharing a single surface micromachined structure. The device utilizes electrical current switching between two perpendicular directions on the structure to achieve a 2-D in-plane magnetic field measurement based on the Lorentz force. The device can concurrently serve as a 1-D accelerometer for out-of-plane acceleration, when the current is switched off. Accordingly, the proposed design is capable of separating magnetic and inertial force measurements, achieving higher accuracy through a single compact device. The sensor supports static operation at atmospheric pressure, precluding the need for complex vacuum packaging. It can alternatively operate at resonance under vacuum for enhanced sensitivity. The device is fabricated using a low-temperature surface micromachining technology, which is fully adapted for above-IC integration on standard CMOS substrates. The resonance frequency of one of the fabricated structures is measured to be 6.53 kHz with a quality factor of $\backslash$sim 30 at a 10-mTorr ambient vacuum level. The magnetic field and acceleration sensitivities of the device are measured using discrete electronics to be 1.57 pF/T and 1.02 fF/g, respectively, under static operation. [2014-0171]},

@article{Sotgiu2020,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1992-2012 IEEE. This work presents a flexible polyimide-based capacitive tactile sensing array with sub-millimeter spatial resolution. The sensor is conceived to be embedded in a multimodal artificial finger to detect and classify the texture morphology of an object's surface. The proposed tactile sensor comprises a 16× 16 array of capacitive sensing units. Each unit is composed of a parallel square electrode pairs (340$\mu$ m × 340$\mu$ m) separated by a compressible air cavity and embedded into a flexible polyimide substrate. Standard MEMS microfabrication techniques were used to develop the sensor. The polyimide device was covered with a thin compressible PDMS layer to tune the normal pressure sensitivity and dynamic range (225-430 $\mu$ m thin PDMS layer resulting in 0.23-0.14 fF/kPa). The detection of the surface morphologies of a regular grating stamp for different orientation and a small metallic nut placed on the sensor is demonstrated, showing a 420 $\mu$ m spatial resolution. The proposed sensor represents a novel capacitive tactile sensing device with a sub-mm resolution of human fingertip sensitivity.},

abstract = {A new multichannel frequency modulated continuous-wave reflectometry diagnostic has been successfully installed and commissioned on ASDEX Upgrade to measure the plasma edge electron density profile evolution in front of the Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies (ICRF) antenna. The design of the new three-strap ICRF antenna integrates ten pairs (sending and receiving) of microwave reflectometry antennas. The multichannel reflectometer can use three of these to measure the edge electron density profiles up to 2 × 1019 m−3, at different poloidal locations, allowing the direct study of the local plasma layers in front of the ICRF antenna. ICRF power coupl- ing, operational effects, and poloidal variations of the plasma density profile can be consistently studied for the first time. In this work the diagnostic hardware architecture is described and the obtained density profile measurements were used to track outer radial plasma position and plasma shape.
